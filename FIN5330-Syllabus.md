Students should be prepared to program ...


### Textbooks

- [Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach 6th Edition](https://goo.gl/Mp9KYT) by Wooldridge
- [Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction](https://goo.gl/BVTr3M) by Taylor

Student with a weak background in econometrics may also want to look at a more introductory textbook. In this category I recommend the following:

- [Introduction to Econometrics](https://goo.gl/boQMUt) by Koop


### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

- Homework problems and computational assignments (25%)
    + Homework assignments will correspond with your readings
    + Julia computational assignments will augment your readings
    
- Replication Projects (25%)
    + You will be asked to replicate the computational aspects of some chosen academic papers
    + [Simulating Supply](http://www2.owen.vanderbilt.edu/nick.bollen/research/nw4.PDF) by Bollen and Whaley
    + [Performance of Statistical Arbitrage in Petroleum Futures Markets](https://goo.gl/6rSMqh) by Alizadeh & Nomikos 
	+ [An Examination of the Robustness of the Weekend Effect](https://goo.gl/hUHEG5) by Connolly 
    + The deliverable will be a markdown document consisting of the essay and Julia code 

- A final project (40%)
    + Students may work in teams of two
    + Project topics will be announced
    + The deliverable will be a markdown with paper and code combined
    
- A final essay (10%)
    + Topic: "What Should Econometricians Do?"
    + I will discuss this with you in class
    + The deliverable will be an markdown document 

Dates for each of these stages will be discussed in class and updated on the Google Sheet schedule. All work will handed in through GitHub. 


### Software 

Finance 5350 is taught using the Julia programming language.

We will be using the professional version of Julia offered by JuliaComputing for free from the following:

- [JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html)

<br>

I will be giving detailed instructions on how to install and get Julia running on your system. 

<br>

We will heavily use both `git` and [github](htts://github.io). Installation instructions and some tutorials are given on a separate page.

<br>

For Finance 5330 we will learn modern document preparation tools:

- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

<br>

I will be giving just-in-time tutorials for each of these tools as we need them. 

**NOT** Microsoft Word! Word is not allowed in Finance 5350!

#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email. Students will be invited to the [Fin 5330 Slack channel](https://fin5330.slack.com) prior to the first week of class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be [downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client via a desktop browser.
