## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course covers modern financial econometrics and data analysis. We will cover
conventional time series models as well as modern algorithmic models. We will 
cover applications to risk management and trading (among other topics).


### Prerequisites

- ECN 4330 or equivalent
- ***Strong economic and statistical logic***


### Textbooks

The _required_ textbook is the following:

* [Applied Econometric Time Series - 4th Edition][Enders] by Walter Enders. 


Other books that we may draw from: 

* [The Econometrics of Financial Markets][CLM] by Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay.

* [Analysis of Financial Time Series - 3rd Edition][Tsay] by Ruey Tsay.

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning][JWHT] by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. 

### Methods of Teaching and Learning

This course will be taught as a graduate seminar-style course. That means that
your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course what you 
individually and collectively put in. 

Most lectures will consist of Jupyter notebooks and slides covering the 
material, though wherever possible I will use the Socratic method. 


### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

* Class Preparation and Participation (10%) - Much has been said about this already above. Let me just emphasize that no student can earn an A in the course who 
does not take this component of their grade seriously!

* Weekly Assignments (10%) - There will be approximately weekly assignments that cover
  the numerical and computational aspects of modeling. 

* Replication Study (20%) - Students must select a study from the literature on empirical finance to replicate.

* Midterm Exam (30%) - This will be a take-home exam. Students will be given two weeks to complete this exam.

* Final Exam (30%) - This will be a take-home exam. Students will be given two weeks to complete this exam (including finals week).


#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email.
Students will be invited to the [Fin 5330 Slack channel](https://fin5330.slack.com) prior to the first week of
class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be
[downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client
via a desktop browser.


#### Programming

I will be presenting code in the Python programming language throughout the 
course. Occasionally, I might present some code in R. You are expected to 
complete your programming assignments and exams in one of these programming
languages. 


### Schedule of Topics


We will attempt to cover the following list of topics:

1. ___Module I___: Foundations: financial data, difference equations, programming, mathematics and statistics, Monte Carlo studies
2. ___Module II___: Linear time series analysis, volatility models, unit roots and cointegration 
3. ___Module III___: Multivariate time series models
4. ___Module IV___: Backtesting trading strategies, data snooping bias, and the bootstrap

***NB:*** I reserve the right to dynamically alter this list as the course progresses. I will announce any such changes in class and on the course Slack channel.
