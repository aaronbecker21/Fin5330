# Chapter 1: Introduction to Derivatives

## What is a Derivative? 

* __Definition:__ a financial instrument that has a value determined by the price of something else


* An agreement where you pay $\$1$ if the price of corn is greater than $\$3$ and receive $\$1$ if the
  price of corn is less than $\$1$ is a derivative
	- This contract can be used to speculate on the price of corn or it can be used to reduce risk. It
	  is not the contract itself, but how it used, and who uses it, that determines whether or not it is
	  risk-reducing.


## An Overview of Financial Markets

The trading of a financial asset involves at least four discrete steps:

* A buyer and a sellter must locate one another and agree on a price

* The trade must be _cleared_ (the obligations of each party are specified)

* The trade must be _settled_ (the buyer and the seller must deliver the cash
  or securities necessary to satisfy their obligations in the required period
  of time)

* Ownership records are updated

___NB:___ notice that well-defined property rights are an assumption of 
properly functioning capital markets.


## An Overview of Financial Markets (Continued)

* Much trading of financial claims takes place on organized exchanges. In the past, the exchange
  was solely a physical location where traders would buy and sell. Such in-person venues have 
  largely been replaced by electronic networks that provide a virtual trading venue. 

* After a trade has taken place, a __clearinghouse__ matches the buyers and sellers, keeping
  track of their obligations and payments. To facilitate these payments and to help manage 
  credit risk, a derivatives clearinghouse typically imposes itself in the transaction, becoming
  the buyer to all sellers and the seller to all buyers. 


## An Overview of Financial Markets (Continued)

* It is possible for large traders to trade many financial claims directly with a dealer bypassing
  organized exchanges. Such trading is said to occur in the __over-the-counter__ (OTC) market

* Exchange activity is public and highly regulated

* OTC trading is not easy to observe or measure and is generally less regulated

* For many categories of financial claims, the value of OTC trading is greater than the value traded
  on exchanges.


## An Overview of Financial Markets (Continued)

There are at least four different measures of a market and its activity

*  __Trading volume__. This measure counts 

* __Market value__. 


* __Notional value__.


* __Open Interest__.
